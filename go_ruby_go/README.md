# Go Ruby Go

The katas we've shared lately have been bouncing between Ruby & Go a lot. We're Rubyists, but we like Go too ... so why not use both?

The challenge: write some actual, bonafide code in Go that's callable in Ruby. The extra challenge: do the same in reverse. Write Ruby code that's callable in Go.

Remember, there are good & bad ways to accomplish anything. Try to meet both of these challenges with style :)
