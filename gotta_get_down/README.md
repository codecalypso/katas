# Gotta Get Down On Friday

The point of the exercise is that it's nice to have a break from the grind, even from our own pet projects, from time to time. Seems like a good thing, like a mini code retreat a la Corey Haines, if you will).

What I would like everyone to do is to take a look at this week is [03_summation_optimization](https://github.com/vosechu/friday_code_challenges/tree/master/03_summation_optimization). Use it as an excuse to get to know Rubinius, think about concurrency, or refactor code. If you have the time to spare, bend or even break the time limit with glee. Remember, the object of a code retreat is not to produce the (tm) solution, but rather to enjoy the activity of writing code in the time that you have.
