# The Littlest Lotto

Inspired by the recent massive Powerball jackpot and the high profitability of
the lottery, a group of your friends have decided to start their own lottery.
In fact, they have already written a highly advanced, completely random,
unbiased, impossible to manipulate method to assist with the project. When
called this method, `#random`, has an equal chance of returning `true` or `false`.
Your friends are asking you to review their code.

Is the existing test enough? If not, can you write the additional necessary tests?

## Part Deux

Turns out someone already invented coin tosses ... pfft. We need to expand our
method to accept an optional argument from 0 to 1 setting the probability of
`#random` returning `true`. What, if any, additional tests are required?
