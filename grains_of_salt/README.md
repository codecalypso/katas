# Grains of Salt

## Testing
I was so inspired by a talk Joe Mastey gave this past Wednesday that I thought I'd dedicate a kata to it. It took some work, but I came up with a sort of example I thought would be interesting.

## Saltine
Enter [saltine](https://rubygems.org/gems/saltine). A tiny little library that doesn't do much, just adds a little salt. In any case, it's up to you to figure out what it does because I want you to test it.

## The Kata
Write one test for saltine. This one test should cover the most important aspect of the library, whatever that is.  Avoid writing tests that run afoul of Joe's principles. Be prepared to defend your one single test as _the_ test for saltine, or at least the most important.
