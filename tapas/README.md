# You Got Your Tapas On My Kata

This week I was hoping we could look at one of Avdi Grimm's videos from [www.rubytapas.com](https://www.rubytapas.com/). Specifically [episode 59](http://www.rubytapas.com/episodes/59-Enumerator) on the Enumerator class.

We deal with Enumerable every day, but how often do we think about solving problems with Enumerator? I know it's not a kata, but here's what I'd like to do: first watch the video, and then look at the last problem you solved that relied on Enumerable & answer a few questions. Would it have been better solved using an Enumerator? If so, how would you have solved it? Otherwise, why not?
