# Investment on Returns

As Rubyists we've been told that explicit returns exact a performance cost and that implicit returns produce more readable &amp; thus maintainable code. Other languages have carried on the mantle of implicit returns, &amp; often folks going back to learn languages without them express dismay, calling them "ugly" or "slow".

I'd like you to take a stand. One way or the other, make the case for or against implicit returns. It's easy to argue philosophy, I'd love to see benchmarks or other concrete data to make your case.
