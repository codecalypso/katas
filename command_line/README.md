# In the beginning, there was the Command Line

Working as we do on long-lived projects, we tend to forget that rails is kind of designed to be a rapid prototyping tool. If you look at the rails script, it does a lot more than just fire up webrick or rails console.

So, this week's kata is easy to describe: in as few steps as possible create a rails application that will accept a form submission ... _using only the command line_. If you need a starting point, then check out the [guide](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/command_line.html#rails-generate) on the topic, but otherwise you should try to do as much from memory as possible. Shortest command history wins.
