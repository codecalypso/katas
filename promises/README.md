# Promises, Promises

A promise is a representation of the output of some computation which hasn't necessarily happened yet. It allows you to continue with execution while the computation is performed independently, & will hopefully be available when it's needed. Promises (or futures, or delays, what-have-you) can help to simplify otherwise thorny issues around writing readable, maintainable code capable of concurrent execution.

So, call this an introduction. The kata is in answering some questions:

1. What problems can a promise solve?
2. Choose a promise implementation in ruby. Why did you chose it?
3. Discuss an example of how you would use promises in one of the common problem domains you've encountered.
