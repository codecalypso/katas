# Suboptimal

SQL refactoring time, yall.

1. Find a query in a system you work with (cnuapp, 8 boxes, personal or open source project ... whatever floats your boat) that is written using a subquery
2. Rewrite the query using a join.
3. ???
4. Profit

When you come on wednesday, be prepared to discuss query characteristics such as how resource intensive the query is (how long did each rendition take? How large was the data set? The result set?), complexity, the query plan, &c.
