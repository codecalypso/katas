# A Magical Rat Man

Design an algorithm to determine if two words are anagrams of each other.  For this exercise, don't worry about comparing them in a dictionary â€“ assume they are both valid.

```ruby
anagram?("god", "dog")
=> true
  
anagram?("anagrammatical", "a magical rat man")
=> true
  
anagram?("fish", "hare")
=> false
```

1. Find a one-line algorithm to solve this problem.
2. See if you can design another algorithm that can identify anagrams more efficiently with longer phrases.
