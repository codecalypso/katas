# Barnacles

I've been programming for over a decade now, and I've developed some habits that run deep. I always drink tea when I code, I listen to energetic music, and my vim setup (while not reaching Pete Brousalis-like heights) is certainly configured in my own image. While I was on sabbatical, I decided to try out something new (ctrl+p, a plugin for file finding in vim), and it was tough. My brain and hands were not interested in co-operating for the first several days. But, once I got past that barrier, the effect on my productivity was noticeable.

So here's the kata for the week: pick part of your habit, and see if you can change it a bit. Those of you who haven't been programming for too long probably feel like you don't have a habit, but I'll bet that you do. A few ideas to get you started:

* Try out a standing desk for a while.
* Figure out how to run your computer without ever touching the mouse.
* If you're a vimmer like me, disable your arrow keys and try not to even use the <kbd>h</kbd><kbd>j</kbd><kbd>k</kbd><kbd>l</kbd> keys if you can avoid it.
* Try out  a new editor. I hear [Atom](https://atom.io/) is neat.


See if you can stick with it for the entire week. Good luck and godspeed.
