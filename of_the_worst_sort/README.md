# Of the Worst Sort

There are a number of sorting algorithms out there. Lots. Loads ... but I'd like you to try one more. Randomize a list ordering, then test to see if it's sorted.

What? Why? Why would ... huh?

To specify, this week's kata is to implement "stupid sort" for an enumerable, then compare its performance in user time to regular sort for lists of various sizes. How bad is it in practice? What's the theoretical upper limit to its badness? Can you explain the math?

For bonus points, optimize your implementation. If it's going to be stupid, make it be stupid as efficiently as possible.
