# The Gilded Rose
by Blake Thomas

Myself & a number of other folks who attended this past railsconf were blown away by Sandi Metz (no surprise) & her presentation, "All the Little Things." In this presentation Sandi went through a kata known as "the Gilded Rose" with her audience. I very much would like to share that with anyone with ears & a keyboard.

Here's the kata: [professor/GildedRose](https://github.com/professor/GildedRose)

As an added twist, if at any point you find yourself struggling with the question of "what next?" then watch five or ten minutes of [Sandi's presentation](http://www.confreaks.com/videos/3412-roa2014-all-the-little-things). When you've finished the kata, compare your result to hers. Do you notice anything different that's of interest? Are there any commonalities that catch your attention? Discuss.
