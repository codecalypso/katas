# Calculated

I've been pushing an agenda lately, one that suggests we eschew best practices for good ideas, and (in particlar) TDD as it's commonly practiced ("Test First Design") and suggesting something more balanced.

Now the hook: I like TDD. As ideas go, it's a spectacular one. So, rather than tearing it down to replace it with something else, my desire has been to inoculate it against superficial objections.

It is with some satisfaction that I introduce this week's kata: [TDD Kata #1](http://osherove.com/tdd-kata-1/). From the linked page: "The following is a TDD Kata- an exercise in coding, refactoring and test-first [...] Try not to read ahead. Do one task at a time ..."

I would love to see someone pop up with the advanced portion, but focus on finishing the basic kata. If you're not satisfied with your performance of the kata, try it again the next day.

That's all. Happy kata :)
