# Precision

This week's kata is a meditation on numbers. Specifically, how big is too big?

In implementing a feature we recently had a discussion about the correct precision & scale for a numeric that would be storing a percentage. Compliance concerns aside, this is a non-trivial question when viewed in the light of optimization.

So, the kata is this: answer the question, what is the right precision (number of significant digits) and scale (number of digits after the decimal) for a percentage? What are you optimizing for?
