# Cruisin' Along

For over two decades, car manufacturers have developed adaptive cruise control (ACC) systems to alter speed based on proximity to other vehicles.  However, these systems aren't perfect.  The most common algorithm at present establishes a minimum following distance (e.g. 3 car lengths).

Work to develop a better cruise control algorithm.

Even at its best, ACC can cause motion sickness and whiplash with its passengers.  How would you work to solve this problem?
