# Delegation

You may have noticed that, when I can, I get someone else to share & lead the discussion about katas. I do this for a couple of reasons. First, it means less work for an already overworked me. But second, and more importantly, something about the influx of new ideas tends to get people interested, excited even.

None-such this week :). However, since we're on the topic of delegation, let me ask you a question: did you know that delegation was available in the standard library? That's right, it is. I didn't even know that until recently, which says something about the depth of my familiarity with stdlib. But I digress.

This weeks kata is straight forward. I have one file, [list.rb](list.rb). It started out as a class inheriting from the built in Array (a mistake if I ever saw one) which overrode the sort method. I reimplemented the class in the next commit using composition, but the class definition has gotten clunkier.

Your mission, should you choose to accept a damn simple mission, is to rewrite List using delegation.

Speaking of delegation, who wants to take next week's kata? Come on, I'm sure someone wants to volunteer ...
