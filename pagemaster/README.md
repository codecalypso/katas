# Pagemaster

Today, everything has an API. We've got APIs for social media, weather and news updates, dining, home automation, you name it. The amount of data behind these APIs can be quite large. As a result, API developers have had to figure out ways to deal with queries that request too much information. Pagination is one of the most common solutions.

Some apps can get away with only retrieving data one page at a time, but some cannot. Pick an API that pages its results (e.g. Github) and write an unpaging facade.
