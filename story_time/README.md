# Story Time

Working with stakeholders not used to agile can be tricky. One of the hardest parts is convincing folks to think about how to deliver value the small units we call stories. Perhaps nearly as difficult is simply writing those stories.

So the standard format for a story that I've come to appreciate goes something like this:

> As a &lt;persona&gt;
>
> I want to &lt;feature&gt;
>
> So that &lt;value&gt;

Lately I've been seeing a rearranged version that puts the last part, the part centered on value, as the first statement. I see the smarts in this, but I find less natural to write or read. Regardless, keep in mind the components: who, what, & why. Personally I often start like this:

> As an Alpert
>
> I want to &lt;feature&gt;
>
> So that I can make money

The absurdity of using your stakeholder as the specific persona is intentional. Its silliness forces your hand into replacing both the first and third lines. The crux of a good story is that it helps everyone to understand its business value, which is easiest to understand when you know who its most valuable to.

With that, to the kata. Think of your favorite atomic behavior of a favorite app (web, mobile, whatever), & write the user story for that behavior. Focus on picking a good persona & succinctly & precisely expressing the value. Now that you've done that, compare the "As an Alpert" version to your proper story. Do you think omitting a meaningful persona & value clause results in a different behavior? Be prepared to discuss why or why not.

Happy story time!
