# How'd We Do

Start by reading through [@PragDave](https://twitter.com/pragdave)'s kata no. 7, [How'd I Do](http://codekata.com/kata/kata07-howd-i-do/) except everywhere you see a pronoun, substitute the plural (we for I, our for my, &c.). Once you've gotten past any comical grammatical constructions, follow through the exercise by picking a random commit on any code base that you're actively working on that is at least six months old and then evaluating the surrounding code as it presently exists.

For funsies, comment on this page with a link to code you're evaluating.

Happy reading :)
