# Objective Attribution

Take a look at the two files, [obj.rb](obj.rb) and [hsh.rb](hsh.rb) ... not pretty, but still interesting. [obj.rb](obj.rb) instantiates a class a number of times, setting all of its attributes to random values each time. [hsh.rb](hsh.rb) does almost exactly the same thing, only instead of using our class it uses a hash.

The first thing I'd like you to do is consider the pros & cons of each approach. To take it to a logical extreme, think about implementing flexible, accessible attributes using hashes over object attributes.

The second thing I'd like you to do is see if there are any speed demons out there interested in timing these two scripts. It's even possible that you might be able to make some adjustments to the scripts wherein your results might change completely (hint: various values of `SAMPLE`)

Have fun!
