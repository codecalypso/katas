# Nameology

I've been thinking about names quite a bit lately, & in fact Jeremy's kata last week (A Kata by Any Other Name) was quite timely as I'm planning to do a tech talk on just this topic in a few days. So I thought to continue on this thread of naming.

First, take a look at [this episode](https://www.rubytapas.com/2013/04/22/episode-087-naming-things-headcount/) of RubyTapas. I think Avdi's discussion of naming as a catalyst for refactoring is pretty spot on, & that brings us to this week's Kata.

1. Find a piece of code in the wild that exhibits a bad name choice
2. Consider the surrounding code & select a better name
3. Update the code to use the new name
4. Reconsider the surrounding code. Can / should it be refactored? How has the meaning changed with this new name?

Bonus points if you can find something that flouts commonly accepted naming conventions in Ruby.

Have fun!
