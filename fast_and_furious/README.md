# Fast &amp; Furious

This weeks kata ([here](http://codekata.com/kata/kata03-how-big-how-fast/)) is borrowed & simple, but critical.

As you do it I want you to think about how you generate estimates for tasks. Specifically when you generate estimates is your approach mathematical in nature? Does it matter?

I'd encourage you to talk to me beforehand if you're new to estimating or otherwise trepidatious. Among other things I can give you a quick introduction to agile & estimation before you power through the kata.
