# Local Confusion

During a Ruby Hack Night last year, I was working with a small group of people, and we came across a situation that I found a bit confusing at first. A few weeks ago, I was helping someone on IRC, and he had the exact same problem. I thought that this problem was a bit interesting, so I brought it to Blake's attention as a possible Kata, and so here it is.

Consider [foo.rb](foo.rb).

What is the output of this code? Why?

Comment out line 10 and run it again.
