# Mafia

I'm developing a digital version of the classic party game, [Mafia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafia_%28party_game%29).  With my current design, all [player types](player_types.rb) inherit from a base [`Player`](player.rb) class.

Which SOLID principles does this design follow?  Which does it not?  How would you refactor it to conform to the principles?
