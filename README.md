# Katas

This is an archive of the katas published for Enova.  A kata is an exercise to help one develop or refine their skills through directed practice.

## Contributions
If you wish to augment our katas with your own, please fork this repo and make your changes there.  We will not be accepting pull requests, as the kata program is no longer active at Enova.
