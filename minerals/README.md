# Minerals

I've been commissioned by a DEA agent to build a showcase for his ~~_rock_~~ **mineral** collection.  We don't have the storage space to store the thousands of photos of all of the different minerals, so I'm hosting them via a content distribution network (CDN).  All of the links to the images use the `asset_path` helper.  Is there an easy way for me to redirect my image links to the CDN?  What are the benefits?  Drawbacks?
