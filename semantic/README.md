# Semantics

There are a lot of websites out there that use pre-built, generic CSS frameworks.  Many of these pages use `div` and `span` tags rather heavily, which disguise the semantics of the information.  Fortunately, there are plenty of more semantic tags that we can substitute in, including some released with [HTML5](http://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_new_elements.asp).

[Here](semantic.htm) we have an example of a page that overuses generic tags and conveys little meaning in its structure.  Rework this page to follow semantic design practices.
