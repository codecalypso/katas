# Fizzy

I've sent out a number of kata's about performance & parallelization, but it occurred to me that one of the biggest ways we've found to make meaningful improvements in our apps performance has been to tune queries. So, for this week I wanted to switch gears a little & do something focused on SQL. Nothing fancy, just any sql exercise to get people thinking about writing queries. A couple of searches later & I stumbled across a classic kata adapted to sql, & I'm going to share it here (shamelessly borrowed from [Greg Lucas](http://datacentricity.net/2012/08/code-kata-for-sql-fizzbuzz/). Spoiler alert!):

_Create something in SQL that returns a result set containing the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three the value should be “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five, “Buzz”.  For numbers which are multiples of both three and five the value should be “FizzBuzz”.  Your results should look like this:_

```
   fizz_buzz_value
   ---------------
   1
   2
   Fizz
   4
   Buzz
   Fizz
   7
   8
   Fizz
   Buzz
   11
   Fizz
   13
   14
   FizzBuzz
   16
   [ ... ]
```
 
Have a good weekend!
