# All Your Base Are Belong to Meme

If you don't know what a meme is, check out [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meme) , but especially check out [this](http://memebase.cheezburger.com/) . There are lots of meme generators out there (like [this one](http://memegenerator.net/)) and memes are practically endemic to social media ... but I don't know of any meme _detectors_.

This week's kata:

1. Pick your meme, & devise an algorithm to detect it
2. Implement the algorithm in your language or platform of choice
3. Try to extend the algorithm. Did it work?

Happy [meme] hunting.
