# Mario Kart

This week's kata has a lot of little inspirations which I'll not bother to enumerate here. My working title is "Mario Kart," which is pretty misleading as it has nothing to do with what we're doing.

**GET READY ...**

Find an example of a method in code that you've worked with recently that has a particularly gnarly arity. Lots of arguments? Optional arguments, weird defaults? Packs everything into an opaque service object? Perfect.

**GET SET ...**

Post the method as-is to a gist (http://gist.github.com). You will be updating this gist after each of the following steps. Check unit tests for this method. Do they exist? If they don't, consider writing at least one.

**GO!**

Refactor this method to accept one argument, a hash. If possible, the default should be an empty hash, or as near as you can come to it. Try to do this quickly & without too much deliberation.

**SECOND LAP**

Further refactor this method to use keyword arguments (ruby >= 2 required). Again, try to do this quickly.

**THE FINISH**

If you have some observations about advantages &amp; disadvantages of each approach (as it was, with a hash, & with keyword arguments) then please include that too. Come to katas on Wednesday prepared to discuss the advantages & disadvantages of each for your particular case.
